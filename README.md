# ArduinoNanoISP
An Arduino Nano as an ISP for burning bootloaders on other Arduinos.

This is a pretty simple KiCad design, with very forgiving trace sizes and tolerances.

You should be able to hot-iron transfer this design (assuming you get rid of the fill zones and make actual net routes for the GND).
In my own case, I used my Varnerized ANT CNC machine to mill a board, which took about 1:20 minutes and had a single tool change, thanks to the massive 0.8mm holes used throughout the design.
